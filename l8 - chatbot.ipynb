    "**System**: The system role or message gives an overall instruction to the LLM. The system message helps to set the behavior and persona of the assistant and it acts as a high-level instruction for the conversation. It's like whispering in the assistant's ear and guiding its responses without the user being aware of the system message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of the system message is that it provides you, the developer, with a way to kind of frame the conversation without making the request itself part of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this message, we can have turns between the user and the assistant and this will kind of continue to go on.\n",
